# 2012: An infrastructure for open data

![bg right:45% people developing the dados.gov.br openly](/slide-decks/images/2024/04/2enda-trilha-sustentabilidade-economica-alexandre-gomes.jpg)


- [Working groups](https://web.archive.org/web/20220704040252/https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Grupos-de-trabalho-da-INDA.ashx) for different concerns
  - [Planning and management](https://web.archive.org/web/20220704041333/https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Gestao-e-normativo.ashx)

# 2016: Open Data Plans

![bg left:45% people developing the dados.gov.br openly](/slide-decks/images/2024/04/10-oficina-pda.jpeg)

- Decree 8.777: establishes an open data planning cycle that every ministry and agency must follow
- [Capacity building workshops](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717053428/http://wiki.dados.gov.br/Capacitacao-para-Elaboracao-de-Planos-de-Dados-Abertos.ashx), in just over a year:
  - over 700 have attended in-person
  - almost 1,800 attendants in online course

---

# Transition

- 2019: open data policy management transferred to Office of the Comptroller-General ‚Äì "CGU" (Decree 9.903)
- 2020: Secretariat for Management and Innovation
  - Data management and data governance
  - responsible for overarching systems: data from all ministries and agencies
  - Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines
    - also for Open Data where applicable!

---

# Remaining Challenges

- Data integration across national and local levels of government
- Integration of international data and developing standards
- Establish an effective feedback loop with data users
- Identifying high value data and fostering data use
- Maturity in data management and data governance
- Data anonymization
- Automatic data licensing

---

# Data integration across levels of government

- Brazil has 5,570 municipalities
  - even keeping track of every data portal URL is hard
- federated data portals: make search easier for citizens
- develop common data standards
- fostering a network of public officials across local administration for discussing and sharing experiences on open data
- leverage interested civil society groups and projects (e.g. [Querido Di√°rio](https://queridodiario.ok.org.br/), [Frag den Staat](https://fragdenstaat.de/))

---

# International data integration and data standards

- thematic networks that share experiences and discuss data standards in specific domains
  - [GIFT](https://fiscaltransparency.net/)
  - [Open Spending](https://www.openspending.org/)
- international data standards in specific domains
  - [Linked Open Vocabularies](https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/)
  - [Fiscal Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/fiscal-data-package/#language)
- integrated searchable databases of international data
  - [OpenCorporates](https://opencorporates.com/) / [OpenLEIs](http://openleis.com/)
  - [EveryPolitician](http://everypolitician.org/) (discontinued)

---

# Effective feedback loop with data users

- data portals must have a feedback mechanism so data users can report errors, ask for clarification, etc.

---

# Identifying high value data and fostering data use

- Open Data Charter / Barometer / Index list of datasets are a start but not enough
- public consultations for open data plans are important but not enough
- data publishers must engage with the data using communities, e.g. in data science / data engineering forums
- participate in events such as [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org/)
- data publishers should hold events to showcase their best data

---

# Maturity in data management and data governance

- the organization should build capacity for public officials
- the departments and people responsible for data should be defined and easy to find out
- have an established data lifecycle
- make open data updates periodic and automatic
- data should be well documented internally, this will in turn enable better documentation for open data

---

# Data anonymization

- should be treated as a security issue (risk of re-identification)
  - e.g. have an internal "red team" try do re-identify anonymized data
- omit or mask sensitive fields
- data aggregation is helpful, but care should be taken
- assess risks and document every decision

---

# Automatic data licensing

- licensing issues are complex
- depend on national copyright / database right laws
- legal analysis should be centralized, achieve an all encompassing solutions
- license choice should come automatically from the top ‚Äì neither middle level officials nor developers can't be expected to deal with such complex legal issues
- usually best to use:
  - [Public Domain Mark](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/) / [Public Domain Dedication License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/) / [CC-Zero](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
  - [CC-Attribution](https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by/) (4.0 or later)
